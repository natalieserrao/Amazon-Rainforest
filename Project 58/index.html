        <h4>
            <p> My Favourite Hobby is reading Funny,Adventurous books. Most of the books I read are Fictional. Almost all Fictional movies are based on the books and still there many scenes that could not be directed. During the pandemic I've been reading the Harry Potter series. There seven books and I am on the sixth book. My favourite one out of all of them was 'The Chamber of Secrets'. In each book it seems the numbers of main characters increase by a hundred. This is why reading is my favourite hobby.
